# Hi 👋, I'm Sharfuzzaman

A passionate frontend developer from Bangladesh who believes great code should feel as good as it looks. <br/> I build interfaces that aren't just pixel-perfect, but human-perfect.

### 🍁 About Me

As a frontend developer, I spend my days bringing designs to life with React, styling with Tailwind's elegant utility classes, and crafting WordPress experiences that don't feel like WordPress. I have this thing for building interfaces that not only look stunning but actually _feel_ right in your hands – the kind of digital experiences that make people say "ahh, this just works."

But here's the thing: I'm not just about code. I'm about connection. I'm about creating things that spark joy, solve real problems, and remind us that technology should enhance our humanity, not complicate it.
